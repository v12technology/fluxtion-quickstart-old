Backward compatibility.
Windows is backward compatible with MS-DOS (aggressively so, even) and MS-DOS used the CR-LF convention because MS-DOS was compatible with CP/M-80 (somewhat by accident) which used the CR-LF convention because that was how you drove a printer (because printers were originally computer controlled typewriters). 
Printers have a separate command to move the paper up one line to a new line, and a separate command for returning the carriage (where the paper was mounted) back to the left margin. 
That's why. And, yes, it is an annoyance, but it is part of the package deal that allowed MS-DOS to win over CP/M, and Windows 95 to win over all the other GUI's on top of DOS, and Windows XP to take over from Windows 98.
